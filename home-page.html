            <p> Are you at a loss for what to do with your dog's poop? Do you want to help the environmet?
                Well then Poop Scoop may be for you! Poop Scoop is an at home service that picks up your dog's poop
                and brings it to our state of the art composting facility. There we use bacteria to break down
                your dog's poop naturally. This is an eco friendly alternative to sending your dog's poop to a landfill,
                where it cannot compost properly, and ends up leeching greenhouse gas into the environment.
